1. Basic Controls:
Players use the mouse to control the aircraft's movement on the screen to avoid attacks and bullets from enemy aircraft.

2. Shooting Mechanism:
Press and hold the left mouse button to fire bullets, and continuous shooting can cause damage to enemy aircraft.
Enemy aircraft have a probability of firing homing missiles.

3. Scoring System:
Attacking and shooting down enemy aircraft can earn points, and the amount of points depends on the type of enemy aircraft.
Losing points will occur after being attacked.

4. Item Collection:
Health Recovery Item: Collecting it restores 25% of health.
Weapon Upgrade: Collecting it increases the weapon level, with 9 levels in each stage.
Shield Item: Provides a temporary shield that can block normal bullets but cannot block BOSS's barrage.

5. Weapon System:
There are three stages of weapons, with 9 levels in each stage. As the level increases, the power and firing speed of the bullets will be enhanced.
When a stage of the weapon is maxed out, the player will gain an additional wingman for each weapon upgrade item collected, and the wingman will automatically attack enemy aircraft, providing additional firepower support for the player.

6. Wingman System:
The wingman can provide additional firepower, helping players to shoot down enemy aircraft more easily.
The wingman has infinite health and will not be damaged by enemy bullets, and can autonomously evade and seek enemies.

7. BOSS Battle:
The game includes BOSS battles, where the BOSS has powerful firepower and health.
The barrage fired by the BOSS cannot be blocked by shield items, and players need to rely on agile movement to avoid it.

The main goal for players is to survive as long as possible, shoot down as many enemy aircraft as possible, collect as many items as possible, and achieve a higher score.

9. End Condition:
